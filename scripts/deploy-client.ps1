# Cache headers are load-bearing, and the two files types need opposite ones.

# hashed bundle, which --delete has already removed from the bucket -> 403 -> a
# blank page that only a hard refresh clears. The CloudFront invalidation below
# does not help: the stale copy is in the browser, past every edge.
