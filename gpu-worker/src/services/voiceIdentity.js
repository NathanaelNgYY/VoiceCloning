// Canonical mapping from an NTU email address to the voices that email owns.
//
// A lecturer owns as many voices as they train — every run makes a new one and
// nothing is ever replaced. The email fixes the base name and copies after the
// first are numbered automatically: DeanVoice, DeanVoice_2, DeanVoice_3. There
// is nothing to type; the name is never chosen by hand.
//
// NTU hands out two addresses for the same mailbox — the SMTP form
// (josephsung@ntu.edu.sg) and the Entra UPN (JOSEPHSUNG@staff.main.ntu.edu.sg).
// Both name one person, so only the local part decides the voice name; the
// domain is validated and then discarded.
//
// Ownership is also recorded on the saved profile (ownerEmail) rather than read
// back out of a name: a name can answer "which voice", never "how many".
//
// This file is duplicated byte-for-byte into the client bundle, the Lambda
// router, and the GPU training worker, which are packaged separately and share
// no module. voiceIdentityParity.test.js fails if the copies drift — copy the
// changed file over the others rather than reconciling them by hand.
